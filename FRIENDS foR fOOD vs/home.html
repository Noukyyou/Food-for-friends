                  <p>After spending some time in Sri Lanka I can say that I have come to love that country, because of the Corona Pandemic I am back in NL.

                    <br><br>
                    In May 2021 I read that the President had introduced a ban on fertilizer imports in Sri Lanka.
            
                    I informed friends that this could sometimes lead to major problems in the country, because it is precisely they who rely on Agriculture.
            
                    <br><br>
                    In April 2022 I could no longer hear how many people had fallen from 3 to 2 and then to 1 meal a day.
            
                    I decided to raise money from family and friends to support SL in their food needs.
                    <br><br>This is how the "Friends for Food" project was born.
