        <h2>What we do</h2> 
        <div class="p2">
            <p>The inhabitants of the village of Gonapinuwala were gathered together to help run a volunteer project. This was supported by us, from the Netherlands, in knowledge and finances. <br><br>
                
                From Sri Lanka, through the local mayor, who designated the poorest in the village, help was offered to select the right people for working in the project.

                It started with 25 families, plowing the land, fertilizing the soil, planting vegetables and fruit trees, etc.<br><br>
                
                The idea also arose to build a greenhouse, so that vegetables from a slightly milder climate can also grow, thus creating a diversity of growth.
                
                <br><br>
                The collaborating families, divided into 2 shifts, morning/afternoon, who built the garden, fertilize and plant the crops are highly motivated to work daily so that they can eat from the garden later.
                
                <br><br>
                I am  so proud of the cooperation in the village. Within a few weeks a harvest was created.
                
                The greenhouse is now well underway in its harvest, so it can be said that the project is going quite well!<br><br>
